# Analytics.js-Rails

A self-hosted copy of [Analytics.js](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics.js), a wrapper for web analytics services, for the Ruby on Rails 3.1+ asset pipeline.

Service A is good at X and Service B is good at Y, unfortunate but true. Use one common interface to standardize and modularize analytics setup across services.

## Installation
